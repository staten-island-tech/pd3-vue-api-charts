      This Vue chart project was made by those two idiots, Leo and Dominic. As
      Whalen likes to call them, they are the two old white muppets from The
      Muppets. In this project, you will find only 2 different charts and 3
      datasets because that was all we needed to do. Our budget was running low
      so that will be all you get from us. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
